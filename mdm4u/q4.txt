Q4. How often do you eat out per week?
0 -< 1 times
1 -< 2 times
3 -< 4 times
5 -< 6 times
7 times (weekly)

4.1 Frequency table
no. of times one eats outside in a week, Count, cum freq, relative freq

0 -< 1 times, 0 -< 1 times, 4, 4/62 = 6.45%
1 -< 2 times, 1 -< 2 times, 16, 12/62 = 19.35%
3 -< 4 times, 3 -< 4 times, 36, 20/62 = 32.26%
5 -< 6 times, 5 -< 6 times, 56, 20/62 = 32.26%
7 times (weekly), 7 times (weekly), 62, 6/62 = 9.68%

Analysis:
	The data has no outliers present. Each category amounts to a relative frequency that doesn’t exceed 35%, meaning that no particular category dominates the data. The highest frequency is tied between “3-<4 times”, and “5-< 6 times”. Considering that these are the two highest choices, and they are located beside each other ordinally, grouping them together reveals that they account for 64.52%, meaning that a student is more likely to eat outside between 3 to 5 times a week, over other frequencies.

4.2 Graph
I chose a histogram because it effectively simplifies and summarizes the grouped numerical categories for the frequency of eating out, helping to visually identify where the majority of the data is concentrated, as well as highlighting trends or patterns across the groups. The histogram is particularly useful in this case, as it accommodates uneven bin ranges (e.g., 0 to <1, 1 to <2, 3 to <4), which are a nuance that histograms handle well. The histogram only contains four bars, making it difficult to discern the shape, however the overall distribution can best be described as right-skewed. The shape starts with higher frequencies on the left and peaks around the middle before dropping down with a tail extending to the right. This tail and the overall slope of the bars suggest a right-skewed distribution. Additionally, the distribution appears unimodal, with the highest bars occurring in the ranges 2.00–4.00 and 4.00–6.00, where the data is most concentrated. These adjacent bars form a single prominent peak, indicating the majority of people eat out within this frequency range.

Mean: 3.8548
Median: 3.5
Mode: 5.5
Most-suited measure: Due to the uneven distribution of bin ranges, the data distribution is somewhat skewed. The mean (3.82 times) is influenced by higher values (e.g., 5-6 times and 7 times weekly), which could skew the result upwards. Therefore, I have chosen the median as the most appropriate measure of central tendency. The median simply represents the middle point of the data and remains unaffected by extreme values or non-uniform ranges, making it a more reliable measure of central tendency for this data set.

Range = 6
Quartile 1 = 1.5
Quartile 2 = 3.5
Quartile 3 = 5.5

Interquartile range = 4
SemiIQR = 2
Variance = 3.4433	
Standard deviation = 1.8556

Analysis
	The distances from Quartile 1 (1.5) to Quartile 2 (3.5), and from Quartile 2 to Quartile 3 (5.5) are both 2 units, indicating an even and balanced distribution across the dataset". The standard deviation (1.8556) further highlights the variability, showing that, on average, data points deviate by about 1.86 units from the mean. Considering that the range of the dataset is 6 units, this suggests moderate variability, as the spread of the data is not too large relative to the range."
