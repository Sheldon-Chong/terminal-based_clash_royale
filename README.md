# Terminal-based clash royale
As part of a final coursework for my computer-science subject in pre-university, I, alongside my groupmate developed this project called Terminal Royale, a game that functions similarly to the mobile strategy game Clash Royale.

## ❓ How to play?
The major difference between our game and Clash Royale is that it does not play real-time, but rather in turn-based fashion. The rules are as follows:

1. **Layout**: Two players will compete on a board. The left side of the board is belongs to Player 1 and the right side belongs to 2. Both regions are connected by two bridges, and 3 towers are positioned at each end.
2. **Round**: Each round, the active player alternates. An active player may deploy cards from their deck, or simply skip their turn
3. **Cards**: You may deploy troops/spells cards, with four on hand at any given time. When deploying a card, you must specify the coordinates to deploy the selected card. You cannot deploy a card outside your assigned region, out of the map, onto another troop, or onto a wall. When deploying a card, a new random card shall take its place in the deck.
4. **Elixir**: Elixir is the energy system that allows players to deploy cards on the field. Each player has their own elixir meter that accumulates every round, whether it's the player’s turn or not. You may deploy as many troops/spells cards before ending turn, as long as your elixir permits it.
5. **Goal**: The aim is for each player to deploy cards onto the board strategically, to target and destroy the opponent's towers, while protecting their own towers. The main tower – the king tower – is the lifeline of the player. If the king tower is destroyed, the game will end and the winner is the player who destroyed the other's tower first
